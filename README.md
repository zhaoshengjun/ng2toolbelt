# Ng2 Toolbelt

The missing toolbelt for Angular 2 in VSCode.


## Goal
The first step is to use command palette to create files based on user selections:

 - User specify the name
 - User select whether it's a component or service or other types
 - create `.ts`, `.html`, `.css` files accordingly.
 
## Reason

 - Manually create 3 files when creating a single component is tooooo tidious
 - Is it just me or someone else often spell the word `component` incorrectly?
 
### Why not use right click?

Right click in VSCode is little bit tricky. I haven't figure it out yet.

Let me know if you have any suggestion/thoughts.
